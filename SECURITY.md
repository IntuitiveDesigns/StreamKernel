# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in StreamKernel, please do NOT open a public issue.

Instead, contact the maintainer privately with details sufficient to reproduce the issue.

## Security Philosophy
- Fail-closed by default
- Explicit authorization (OPA)
- Defense-in-depth (mTLS, RBAC)
- Secure-by-default configurations

Thank you for helping keep StreamKernel secure.
